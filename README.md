# IIV Block

This module provides a block type to add a simple text snippet with an image to any region in your layouts.
IIV Blocks are reusable.
Images can be on the left or the right or up or down, an image style applied,
they can have a link or title...
And do not forget to try animations...

There's an overview page for admins to delete unused blocks.
Using IIV Blocks you can create fancy landing pages or whatever your fantasy yields.


## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

## Usage

1. Navigate to the layout where you want the IIV Block.
2. Click to add a block and search for "IIV Block".
3. Add a file and configure the settings to meet your needs.
4. WARNING : JUST CONFIGURE IMAGE AND TEXT PARAMETERS AND THEN ADD BLOCK BEFORE COMMING BACK TO MODIFICATION FOR VISIBILITY AND OTHER THINGS
5. To reuse an existing IIV Block on another layout, search for the block.
  This will create a separate instance of the block.

## Dependencies

The image module is required (ships with core and is usually enabled).
